    Dog Years Calculator: American vetrinarian 
    To estimate a dog's age in human years, a general guidline is to consider the first year of a dogs life as equivelent to 15 human years. 
    The second year is roughly 9 human years, and subsequent years can be estimatrd as 4-5 human years each.

    Enter dog's Age:
    Large/small

    5 year old large dog: 15 + 9 + (5-2) * 5 = 39 years
    7 year old small dog: 15 + 9 + (7-2) * 4 = 44 years
